* Cl-Kademlia 

Cl-Kademlia is a implementation of [[https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf][kademlia algorithm]]

Inspired by [[https://github.com/bmuller/kademlia][python kademlia]], however make the "udp over rpc" own, drop the spiders stuff.

The code is messy now. I'll keep polishing it while possible :)
